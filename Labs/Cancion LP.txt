Will you remember all the danger we came from?
Burning like embers, falling tender
Long before the days of no surrender, years ago
And will you know?

So smoke 'em if you got 'em
'Cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you

I'll never get to heaven
'Cause I don't know how
Let's raise a glass or two

To all the things I've lost on you, ooh-oh
Tell me: Are they lost on you? Ooh-oh
Just that you could cut me loose, ooh-oh
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?

Ooh-oh, ooh
Is that lost on you?
Ooh-oh
Baby, is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?

Wish that I could see the machinations
Understand the toil of expectations in your mind
Hold me like you never lost your patience
Tell me that you love me more than hate me all the time
And you're still mine

So smoke 'em if you got 'em
'Cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you

Let's take a drink of heaven
This can turn around
Let's raise a glass or two

To all the things I've lost on you, ooh-oh
Tell me: Are they lost on you? Ooh-oh
Just that you could cut me loose, ooh-oh
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?

Ooh-oh, ooh
Is that lost on you?
Ooh-oh
Baby, is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?

Lost on you
Lost on you
(Oh-oh, ooh-oh)

Let's raise a glass or two

To all the things I've lost on you, ooh-oh
Tell me: Are they lost on you? Ooh-oh
